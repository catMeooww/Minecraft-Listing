________________________________________________
## Create a list or log-in one
 - To create a list for your world, go to create page, insert it name in the input and click in create list.
 - If theres a list with the same name, increase the list number to create it.
 - To log-in an existent list, insert it name in the input and click in Log-in List.(you need to put it number in the cyan input in case theres another list with the same name)

## Managing List
 - You can see the list itens in the List Content, There will be a server message saying that the list has been created.
 - Add items to the list in the Add Item section, You can add a simple item (emerald), or tag it with Important (nether star).
